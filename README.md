# 🏥 NextGen Intelligent Healthcare System for Emergency Services 🚑

## 🔍 Project Overview

In modern urban environments, the delay in ambulance response due to **traffic congestion**, **poor routing**, and **manual patient monitoring** can lead to severe consequences. This project proposes a **smart, AI-powered emergency response system** integrating:

1. **Real-time patient monitoring using IoT sensors**
2. **Intelligent ambulance routing using location APIs**
3. **Dynamic traffic signal management to prioritize emergency vehicles**

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Monitor patient vitals in **real-time** using embedded systems.
- Route ambulances dynamically using **AI algorithms** and **live traffic data**.
- **Manage traffic signals dynamically** to ensure the smooth passage of ambulances.

## 🧠 System Modules

### 1. Real-Time Patient Monitoring
- Utilizes **IoT sensors** (Pulse, ECG, Humidity) connected to **Arduino Uno**
- Displays vitals on **LCD (I2C)** and uploads data to **ThingSpeak Cloud**
- Enables hospitals to **remotely track patient condition**

### 2. AI-Driven Ambulance Routing
- Uses IP/GPS-based ambulance location to:
  - Retrieve coordinates
  - Convert to human-readable addresses
  - Identify **top 10 nearest hospitals**
  - Estimate **distance, duration, and traffic** using:
    - **Geoapify API**
    - **OpenRouteService (ORS) API**
    - **TomTom API**
- Generates optimal route with **interactive maps and step-by-step navigation**

### 3. Dynamic Traffic Management System
- Employs **RF Transmitter & Receiver (433MHz)** modules
- Prioritizes ambulance passage at junctions
- Controls **4 traffic modules (Red, Yellow, Green)** using **Arduino**
- Sounds buzzer on ambulance detection and dynamically manages signal flow
